Precedences

  precedence on PLUS is used to resolve conflict on
    LALR
      state 12. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr PLUS expr" and shift PLUS resolved as reduce (%left PLUS).
      state 12. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr PLUS expr" and shift TIMES resolved as shift (PLUS < TIMES).
      state 13. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr TIMES expr" and shift PLUS resolved as reduce (PLUS < TIMES).

  precedence on TIMES is used to resolve conflict on
    LALR
      state 12. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr PLUS expr" and shift TIMES resolved as shift (PLUS < TIMES).
      state 13. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr TIMES expr" and shift PLUS resolved as reduce (PLUS < TIMES).
      state 13. Conflict between reduce by "expr -> expr TIMES expr" and shift TIMES resolved as reduce (%left TIMES).
