# Version Compatibility

Lrama must run on BASERUBY when building CRuby. The supported version is
currently Ruby 3.1 or later.

When updating Lrama, ensure that the grammar output remains compatible with the
Ruby version you are targeting. The repository maintains branches for older
Ruby versions; see `README.md` for the list.
