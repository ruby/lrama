# History

Lrama was created to provide a Bison-compatible parser generator that can be
run with the Ruby toolchain used in CRuby builds. It maintains compatibility
with Bison-style grammars while adding features needed by Ruby's parser,
such as error tolerance and grammar parameterization.

The project is maintained alongside the Ruby language development process and
shares many of the same constraints (BASERUBY compatibility, default gems
only).
